    # read video file

    # run first frame logic

    # for every frame and object in the list:

        # stabilize frame by frame

        # track

        # check tracking with background substraction

        # track everything

        # update objects

        # deal with the newly not detected with spical logic

        # filter bad objects

        # detect every N frame, 

            # filter bad objects after detection

    # save the most good tracks

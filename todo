- make sure saved tracks cut the failed triple steps at the end! (in trust_level) in save_tracks [DONE]
- improve class_id voting (with every detection only,and with prob) [DONE]

- print frame id everytime (or percentage to end) [DONE]

- if theta is 0 (because of no move) keep the rotation angel (0 or as last)


- use :
    - use detection prob


- docs:
    - talk about cv2.TrackerKCF_create


- post process:
    - average size [DONE] # horzental or vertical taken
    - vote for class (car take over) [DONE] majority taken
    - calcuate theta [DONE]
    - smooth trajectory
    - real dimensions (maybe a preprocee to calib with each video with known object while the data still in meters)
